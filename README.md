Cpp
===
C++ projects.

* **CppPrimer**: Learning C++11 from the book C++ Primer. Adding boost equivalent whenever possible.
  * C++11 is not always available in work environment due to backward compatability. Check **util** for codes of older style.
* **ProjectEuler**: Easy programming puzzles, for refreshing C++.
  * Python or Java is better in prototyping.
* **util**: Frequently used utitlity codes. C++11 and Boost are intentionally avoided as these codes will be used on older systems.
